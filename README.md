# GPT-Text-to-SQL

GPT-Text-to-SQL is the Python package that makes querying databases as easy as asking questions in plain English. With this package, you don't need to know SQL to get the answers you need from your databases.

The package provides a simple interface for interacting with various databases. At the moment, SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, and MS SQL Server are supported. These interfaces are called "Connectors" because they connect you to your data faster than you can say "SELECT * FROM table;".

## Installation
### With pip
Installing GPT-Text-to-SQL is as easy as pip-pip-pip:
```
pip install gpt_text_to_sql
```
